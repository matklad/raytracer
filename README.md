Development
-----------

Make sure you have **at least** GHC 7.4.2, then just do the usual
[cabal-dev](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-dev) routine:

```bash
$ cabal-dev install-deps
$ cabal-dev configure
$ cabal-dev build
```

And please, **please**, PLEASE, follow the [**style guide**](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide)!
